## ðŸ“‚ Assignments

### 1. ðŸ”¢ Latin Square Game
> This program allows players to solve a Latin Square puzzle, adhering to the rules that each row and column must contain unique numbers from 1 to the size of the square (its dimension).

### 2. ðŸ§¬ Chemical Formula Parses
> This project processes chemical formulas, expanding them into full molecular representations, validating parentheses, and calculating the total number of protons for each formula based on atomic numbers from the periodic table. Dynamic stacks are used to efficiently manage elements and parentheses while parsing the formulas.

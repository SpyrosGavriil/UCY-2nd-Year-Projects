@brief Documentation for EPL232 Homework 1 - Latin Square Game

### Overview

This program implements a Latin Square game where the player can interactively fill a square grid with numbers, adhering to the rules of a Latin square (no duplicate numbers in any row or column). The program provides a user interface for inserting or clearing values in the grid, as well as saving the game state to a file.

The program includes the following key features:
- Display of the current state of the Latin square in a structured format.
- Command-based input for modifying the square (inserting or clearing values).
- Input validation to prevent illegal moves such as duplicate values in rows or columns.
- Saving the current state of the game to a file.
- The ability to exit the game gracefully by saving the current progress.

### How to Play

1. The player will be presented with a Latin square grid. The grid contains cells where the player can input numbers.
2. The player can input commands in the format `i,j=val`, where:
   - `i` and `j` represent the row and column indices (1-based).
   - `val` represents the value to be inserted. Use `0` to clear a cell.
3. The player can input `0,0=0` to save the game state to a file and exit.
4. The game automatically ends when all cells are filled with valid non-zero numbers.

### Special Rules

- A Latin square must contain no duplicate values in any row or column.
- Certain cells may be "protected," meaning they cannot be cleared or modified once a value is placed there.
- The input format strictly follows the `i,j=val` structure; incorrect formats will result in an error message.

### Code Stability

The code is stable and has been tested for normal gameplay. It handles most user errors gracefully, such as incorrect input formats or attempts to break the Latin square rules.

### Known Bugs and Issues

There are currently no known major bugs.

### Final Notes

The documentation here is accurate and reflects the final state of the project. Any changes or enhancements made after submission will be documented accordingly.
